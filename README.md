# NIFTY 50 Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview
This repository contains code for forecasting NIFTY 50 stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The project focuses on analyzing 1-minute interval data spanning from 2015 to 2024. LSTM models are chosen for their ability to handle sequential data and capture long-term dependencies, making them ideal for time series forecasting tasks.

## Key Features
- LSTM model implementation for time series forecasting.
- Data preprocessing scripts tailored for 1-minute interval data.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.
- Visualizations to interpret and analyze forecasted results.

## Results
Include insights and visualizations from your model's forecasts here.
